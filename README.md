### Structure:
The repository is structured in the format of the Experiment numbers as mentioned in Section 4 under the folder 
“Final Code for Submission”. 
The final code to run is in the Experiment 6 folder.

There is also another folder by the name “Web Scrapping and Datasets” which has the initial datasets. 
Proper datasets can be found in the corresponding Experiment number folder.
### Executing Code:
Firstly Python 3.9 must be installed either as standalone or with anaconda and environment variables must be set 
correctly. 
We will need to install NumPy, sklearn, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Transformers, NLTK, Punket, Tkinter, 
sentence_transformers and json and any other dependencies if required. 

Download or open the folder Experiment 6 in an editor, VS code is recommended and set python interpreter 
path correctly.

Run in terminal “python bot_app.py”
